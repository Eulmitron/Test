# Sierra Trout Quest

Sierra Trout Quest is a simple survival fishing game with SNES-style graphics built using Python and Pygame. Move through the mountains, fish in the lakes, and try to catch rare trout before your energy runs out.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Pygame (see `requirements.txt`)

## Running the Game
1. Install the Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python sierra_trout_quest.py
   ```

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move your character around the screen
- **Space**: Cast your line and attempt to catch a trout when standing near water
- **E**: Eat a fish from your inventory to regain energy
- **Close Window**: Quit the game

Catch a Golden Trout to unlock harsher conditions. If your energy reaches zero, the adventure ends.
